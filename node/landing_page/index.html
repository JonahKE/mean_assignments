            <p>Create a small node server capable of handling the following request URLs:</p>

            <p><b>localhost:6789/</b></p>
            <p>This route should serve a view file called index.html and display a greeting.</p>

            <p><b><a href="/ninjas">localhost:6789/ninjas</a></b></p>
            <p>This route should serve a view file called ninjas.html and display information about ninjas.</p>

            <p><b><a href = "/dojos/new">localhost:6789/dojos/new</a></b></p>  
            <p>This route should serve a view file called dojos.html and have a form (don't worry about where the form should be sent to).</p>

            <p><b>If the URL is anything other than the ones above, have an error page load saying that the URL requested is not available.</b></p>
