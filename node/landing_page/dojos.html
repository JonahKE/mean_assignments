            <p><i>According to Wikipedia...</i></p>
            <p>"Dojo (道場 dōjō) is a Japanese term which literally means 'place of the way'. Initially, dōjōs were adjunct to temples.</p>

            <p>In the Western world, the term dōjō primarily refers to a training place specifically for Japanese martial arts such as aikido, judo, karate, or samurai;[1] in Japan, any physical training facility, including professional wrestling schools, may be called dōjō because of its close martial arts roots.[2] The term can also refer to a formal training place for any of the Japanese arts ending in 'do', meaning 'way'."</p>
